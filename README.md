# Simple MVC CMS

Simple MVC CMS is a basic CMS built as a "learning by doing" project and based 
on the [Create A Simple MVC Framework tutorial by Domagoj Salopek] 
(http://www.domagojsalopek.com/Details/Create-a-simple-PHP-MVC-Framework/28).

The goal of this project is to produce a simple but robust CMS that could be
used for small sites.

My goal here is to learn and improve my coding so you are welcome as long as 
your contribution has the following characteristics:

* constructive (the goal is to learn / help / explain, not to show off)
* explanatory: please explain and comment your contributions (again the goal is 
to learn the "how and why")

## Setup

Once you have checked out or downloaded the files, you'll need to do these:

1. create a local database to store the data about pages and users.
You can use the [db.sql] (db.sql) file to populate the local database
2. edit the (config.php) [config.php] file to set up the database login data
3. optionally you might want to edit your hosts file and apache configuration 
files to change the local URL of the application
